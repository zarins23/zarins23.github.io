Feeling the need to understand everything in detail prior to using that information in a practical sense (coding) is sort of an impedement when it comes to learning code. Switching my learning style from reading and understanding the theory or concept in its entirety to reading and practicing even without fully understanding that portion of the coding language is difficult for me to transtion into. Though I am learning to practice writing code without a full grasp of the reading material, I see that I gain the concept better while I code and use the reading as a reference or to verify if what I interpreted from my code is in fact what is detailed in the reading material. It has been a rocky start, but I am gaining speed and learning the material well enough to explain to others.
