My background is in Biology, I was on track to getting into Pharmacy school however I knew deep down that it was not the route I wanted to take. So I attended various software engineering bootcamp prep courses around the Bay Area and they never seemed to teach in a way that would make transitioning into web development fun and interesting. That is when I looked into Flatiron and the information I read on the prep course site in the first 10-15 minutes was way more informative than a week of one of the bootcamp preps I attended. That combined with the information my brother provided me about how to make an interactive website, had me hooked and I knew I needed to pursue web development.

In addition, I hope to combine my background in Biology with software engineering to help produce a software that can identify specific biomarkers for certain cancers. I have worked on similar projects, however I would like to delve into the software portion of it all to really see it from an engineers point of view and where some of the pitfalls are.

Thanks for reading!
